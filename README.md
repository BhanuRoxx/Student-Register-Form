I developed a fully functional student registration form that combines the power of HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a seamless user experience. 

This code highlights my skills in both front-end and back-end web development, demonstrating my ability to:

Design Intuitive User Interfaces: Crafted a clean and user-friendly registration form using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

Implement Backend Functionality: Leveraged PHP to handle form submissions and securely store data in a MySQL database.
